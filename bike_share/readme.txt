Websites I looked at to find information on how to proceed

Udacityâ€™s peer chat and mentor help
GitHub
Python
Stackoverflow

I also spoke with two friends who are programmers and asked them how to proceed when I became stuck 
on a couple parts, specifically asked them not to answer it but to point me in the right direction (usually straight to GitHub)
